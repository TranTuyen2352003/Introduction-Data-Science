# Introduction-Data-Science
This repository contains the lab materials for the Data Science Fundamentals course that I have completed during my university studies. The labs cover various topics including Python basics, data cleaning and preprocessing, data querying, and building machine learning models.

## Content
### Python Basics
- **Introduction**: Learn about the Python programming language and its importance in data science.
- **Basic Data Types, Variables, and Operators**: Understand different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and how to declare variables. Explore various operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.
- **Control Flow Structures**: Explore control flow structures including loops (for and while loops) and conditional statements (if, elif, else).
- **Functions and Modules**: Learn how to define and use functions in Python, and how to organize code into modules for better reusability.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Techniques for dealing with missing or incomplete data.
- **Data Normalization and Standardization**: Methods to scale numerical features to a standard range.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Identifying and removing duplicate records from datasets.
- **Feature Engineering Techniques**: Strategies for creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.

### Data Querying
- **Retrieving Data**: Methods for fetching data from various sources such as databases, CSV files, and APIs.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using libraries like Pandas and NumPy to perform initial analysis and gain insights into the dataset.
- **Basic Data Visualization**: Introduction to plotting data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends, distributions, and relationships within the data.

### Machine Learning Models
- **Introduction to Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**: Understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.
- **Building Classification and Regression Models**: Learn how to train and evaluate classification and regression models using various algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation and Validation Techniques**: Methods for assessing model performance and ensuring generalization to unseen data.
- **Introduction to Popular ML Libraries**: Overview of widely used machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, and how to leverage them for building and deploying models.
